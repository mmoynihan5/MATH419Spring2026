            <alert>Important</alert>: I <em>want</em> to see you in student hours, and will happily make appointments with you outside of the regular hours.  I'm also available by email and will respond within 24 hours, usually much sooner.  There is little I enjoy more than discussing mathematics, so you are really doing me a favor by coming to see me.

            An introduction to algebraic structures including groups, rings, and fields, and their sub-structures, as well as homomorphisms and isomorphisms.
            Fundamental number theoretic topics are included to establish connections and provide examples in the context of abstract algebra.

              <q>
                Don’t just read it; fight it!
                Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs.
                Is the hypothesis necessary?
                Is the converse true?
                What happens in the classical special case?
                What about the degenerate cases?
                Where does the proof use the hypothesis?
              </q>

      <title>Course Goals</title>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Extend your mathematical reasoning skills: abstracting, generalizing, and formal proof.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Strengthen your mathematical writing with appropriate use of mathematical language, notation, and symbolism.
            </p>
          </li>


<li>
  <p>
    Increase your confidence with the theoretic structure of mathematics: the role of definitions, examples, and theorems; abstract concepts; and logical reasoning.
  </p>
</li>
          
        </ul>
