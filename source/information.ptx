          <alert>Important</alert>: I <em>want</em> to see you in student hours, and will happily make appointments with you outside of the regular hours.  I'm also available by email and will respond within 24 hours, usually much sooner.  There is little I enjoy more than discussing mathematics, so you are really doing me a favor by coming to see me.

              Don’t just read it; fight it!
              Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs.
              Is the hypothesis necessary?
              Is the converse true?
              What happens in the classical special case?
              What about the degenerate cases?
              Where does the proof use the hypothesis?
