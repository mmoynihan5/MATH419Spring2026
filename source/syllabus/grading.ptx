      <title>Practically Perfect Proofs</title>

      <p>A practically perfect proof will be due approximately once a week.
        Each will need to be practically perfect in order to receive credit.
        If your work is not practically perfect, you will receive feedback and may resubmit the proof as many times as needed until the proof is practically perfect!
      </p>

      <p>
        An honest attempt at each <m>P^3</m> assignment must be submitted on the initial due date in order to be eligible for revision.
        Also, revisions must be submitted within one week of receiving feedback.
        Use of outside sources such as Chegg, Math Overflow, ProofWiki, ChatGPT, or other students in the course will be considered academic dishonesty.
        You will receive no credit for the assignment and not be allowed any revisions.

      <title>Final Exam</title>

      <p>
        The final exam will be cumulative.
        As you work through the semester, always keep this in mind.
        You need to grow beyond basic understand to see things at a deeper level.
        That is how you will retain knowledge and be able to succeed on new problems!
