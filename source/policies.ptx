    <title>Attendance</title>

    <p>
      Regular attendance is an expectation for all students in this course because attendance is important for learning the material.
      But attendance means more than simply physical presence.
      It also requires mental presence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There is no attendance grade.
      I expect you to take care of yourself and those around you.
      IF YOU ARE ILL, YOU SHOULD NOT ATTEND CLASS.
      Otherwise, I expect to see you in class.

    <title>Late work</title>
    <p>
      Make-up exams should be a rare occurrence reserved for illness and/or emergencies.
      Requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis and are not guaranteed.
      In particular, I will consider recent attendance and recent homework to see if you have been participating in the course.
    </p>
    
    <!-- <p>
      Everyone will be given 5 late passes to extend homework due dates (with full credit)!
      However, you can only extend the due date by one week.
      This is to make sure you do not fall too far behind and to make sure we are all ready to participate in class.
    </p> -->

    <title>Academic Integrity</title>

    <p>
      Integrity is essential to academic life.
      Consequently, students who enroll at Framingham State University agree to maintain high standards of academic honesty and scholarly practice.
      They shall be responsible for familiarizing themselves with the published policies and procedures regarding academic honesty.
      Common infractions of the Policy on Academic Honesty in mathematics courses include, but are not limited to:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Plagiarism: claiming as one's own work the published or unpublished literal or paraphrased work of another.
            It should be recognized that plagiarism is not only academically dishonest but also illegal;
            (Proofs are writing! Using someone else's proof without proper citation is plagiarism!)
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <p>
            Use of dishonest procedures in computer, laboratory, studio, or field work;
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <p>
            Cheating on exams, tests, quizzes, assignments, and papers, including the giving or acceptance of these materials and other sources of information without the permission of the instructor(s);
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <p>
            Unauthorized collaboration with other individuals in the preparation of course assignments;
          </p>
        </li>

    </p>
  </paragraphs>


  <paragraphs>
    <title>Generative AI</title>

    <p>
      Use of AI in proof writing is prohibited.
      All proofs are writing assignments and should be done on your own.
      Also, LLM's are good at producing nonsense that sounds rational.
      They are bad at producing actual proofs.
    </p>

    <title>Antiracism at FSU</title>

  
    <p>
      At Framingham State University, faculty, staff, and students work together to sustain a learning, working, and living community free from hate, discrimination, harassment, and intolerance.
      We recognize the damaging effects of systemic racism - including policies, structures, and historic practices - on the experience and success of communities of color.
      Coming from different backgrounds and different levels of privilege, we can all affirm and engage in antiracist work.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Diversity of voices, and of minds, strengthens our ability to solve problems and to ask and answer questions about the world we share.
      As your instructor, I commit to upholding community values of inclusion, civility, accessibility, and mutual respect.
      I expect this class to commit to creating a community that affirms and welcomes all persons from diverse backgrounds and experiences, and supports the realization of everyone's potential.
